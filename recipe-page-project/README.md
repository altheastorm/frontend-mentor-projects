## My process
First, I included semantic HTML tags in the html page (headers, sections, divs, etc.). Then I created the CSS page (recipe.css), linked it to the html page and began applying styles. 

Once I was done with the styles for the desktop version, I used media queries to make the page mobile-responsive. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### Continued development

I would like to focus more on using CSS flexbox and grid in future projects. I would also like to learn how to write streamlined/neat CSS.
